I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun,
I'm reborn in every moment,
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining

It's my, my, time to butterfly
What i've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is a revival

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

I walk through the fire
I begin again
I burn through my skin
Cause i, cause I learned to feel it
Reaching for the truth
Not afraid to lose
What shout out at me like a rifle
Was a revival, revival
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I admit that it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, time to realize

What i've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is a revival

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

This won't take too long you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me
Oooh
What shout out at me like a rifle
Was a revival, revival

What i've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is a revival

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
What i've learned is so vital
More than just revival
This is my revival, this a revival
